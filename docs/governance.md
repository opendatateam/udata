# Governance

The project has been initiated by the [French government team][etalab] and is now used by other countries (Luxembourg, Serbia, you?). In May 2016, we have moved the project to its own dedicated Github organization to reflect the fact that itâ€™s an international effort and as such should be fully developed in the open.

## Bugs

Bugs are [reported directly on Github][github-new-issue] following the proposed template.

## Discussion

For daily chat, development discussions and so on we idle on [Gitter][gitter].
