# Governance

The project has been initiated by the [French government team][etalab] and is now used by other countries (Luxembourg, Serbia, you?). In May 2016, we have moved the project to its own dedicated Github organization to reflect the fact that it’s an international effort and as such should be fully developed in the open.

## Bugs

Bugs are [reported directly on Github][github-new-issue] following the proposed template.

## Discussions

We’re trying to develop this project in the open as much as possible. We created a dedicated [Github discussions][github-discussions] where we discuss each new strategic change and invite the community to give a valuable feedback. You’re encouraged to join and participate.
