# Governance

The project has been initiated by the [French government Open Data team][opendatateam] and is now used by other countries (Luxembourg, Serbia, you?). In May 2016, we have moved the project to its [own dedicated GiHub organization](https://github.com/opendatateam) to reflect the fact that it’s an international effort and as such should be fully developed in the open.

## Bugs

Bugs are [reported directly on Github][github-new-issue] following the proposed template.

## Discussions

We’re trying to develop this project in the open as much as possible. We created a dedicated [Github discussions][github-discussions] where we discuss each new strategic change and invite the community to give a valuable feedback. You’re encouraged to join and participate.
