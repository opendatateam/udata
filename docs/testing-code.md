# Testing your code

There a three complementary ways of testing your work: unit tests for the backend,
unit tests for the frontend and integration tests.

## Test middlewares

If you need to use an alternative Mongo or Elasticsearch instance during tests,
you can provides the alternate urls in you `udata.cfg`
with `MONGODB_HOST_TEST` and `ELASTICSEARCH_URL_TEST`.

**ex**: To make use of the tmpfs based middleware provided by docker-compose, use:

```python
MONGODB_HOST_TEST = 'mongodb://localhost:27018/udata'
ELASTICSEARCH_URL_TEST = 'localhost:9201'
```

And then start docker-compose with the extra file:

```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up
```

This will start 2 extra services, an Elasticsearch and a MongoDB,
both tmpfs based and your tests will make use of it and run faster.


## Backend unit tests

The easiest way is to run Python tests with [nosetest][].

```shell
$ nosetests --immediate udata
```

You can launch a unique test too:

```shell
$ nosetests --immediate --stop --tests=udata/tests/api/test_datasets_api.py:DatasetResourceAPITest.test_reorder
```

If you want a fancy display, you can use the [nose-mocha-reporter][] (not installed by default)
with the dedicated option:

```shell
$ nosetests --with-mocha-reporter --immediate --stop --tests=udata/tests/api/test_datasets_api.py:DatasetResourceAPITest
```

## Frontend unit tests

For frontend (and administration) testing, we use the following tools:

* [Karma][] as test runner
* [mocha][] as test framework
* [Chai][] (and [some plugins][chai-plugins]) as assertions library
* [Sinon.JS][] for spies, stubs and mocks

All tests are located in the `specs` directory and should have the following naming pattern
`*.specs.js` to be recognized by Karma.

The most simple way to launch them is by using the dedicated invoke task:

```shell
$ inv jstest
```

It will run a single test pass using PhantomJS as browser.

You can run the tests continuously as changed are detected by the `--watch` option:

```shell
$ inv jstest --watch
```

For more advanced usage, you can use the npm dedicated run-scripts:

```shell
# Single run in PhantomJS
$ npm -s run test:unit
# Watch and run tests on change in PhantomJS
$ npm -s run test:watch
```

You can pass any option to karma after the `--`:

```bash
# Run tests a in new Chrome and Firefox instances
$ npm -s run test:unit -- --browsers Chrome,Firefox
# Single run with JUnit xml output
$ npm -s run test:unit -- --reporters mocha,junit
```

!!! note
    If using Chrome launcher without `chrome` being on the `$PATH` (or using Chromium),
    you need to specify the binary path by settings the environment variable
    `CHROME_BIN`

See [the official karma documentation][karma] for more details about the possible parameters.

### Testing on IE

You can run the test suite under Modern.ie VMs installed with either [ievms][]
or [iectrl][] (installation is detailed on websites).

```bash
# Install IE11 under Win7 (time to have one or more coffee!)
$ iectrl install 11
# Run tests under IE11
$ npm -s run test:unit -- --browsers 'IE11 - Win7'
```

!!! note
    uData tests ensure the compatibility with IE version(s) [officially supported by Microsoft][ie-support].
    Right now, itâ€™s IE11.

You maybe need to manually close the first time popup on first run.
To do so, launch the VM then launch the test suite:

```bash
$ iectrl start 11
$ npm -s run test:unit -- --browsers 'IE11 - Win7'
# You can close it after
$ iectrl close 11
```

## Integration tests

We use [Watai][] which is using [webdriver API][] on top of [Selenium][].

First, install and launch Selenium:

```shell
$ selenium-server -p 4444
```

Then install watai and now you can run integration tests:

```shell
$ watai specs/integration/  --config '{"email":"name@example.org","password":"yourpassword","username":"yourusername"}'
```

You can easily exclude some tests if you want to run a particular range of test(s), here to run only test 4:

```shell
$ watai specs/integration/  --config '{"ignore":[1,2,3,5,6,7], "email":"name@example.org","password":"yourpassword","username":"yourusername"}'
```
