# Local dependencies

## Python and virtual environment

It is recommended to work within a virtualenv to ensure proper dependencies isolation.
If you're not familiar with that concept, read [Python Virtual Environments - a Primer][].

Alright, now you can [install virtualenv][install-virtualenv] and then type these commands knowing what you are doing:

```shell
$ virtualenv --python=python2.7 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r udata/requirements/develop.pip
$ pip install -e udata/
```

Some dependencies have an optionnal compilation support for Cython
resulting in more performances (mostly XML harvesting).
To enable it, you need to install Cython before all other dependencies:

```shell
$ pip install Cython
$ pip install -r udata/requirements/develop.pip
$ pip install -e udata/
```

## NodeJS and modules

You need NodeJS 4.2. If it's not already installed or you have a different version,
you should consider [installing NVM][nvm-install] which uses the existing `.nvmrc`.

```shell
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
```

Then install JavaScript dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Once it's done, you should be able to run the build command for JS and CSS:

```shell
$ inv assets_build
```

!!! note
    If you plan to hack on statics (JS, CSS files), a dedicated command `inv assets_watch` will watch these files and recompile (the modified part only!) on each save.
