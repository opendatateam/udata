# System dependencies

## Python requirements

udata requires [Python][] 3.6, its development tools and some libraries to be installed (with their headers).
Most of them might already be installed as they are common development dependencies.
The full dependencies list is:

* Pillow (Image processing)
    * libjpeg
    * zlib
    * libpng
    * libtiff
    * libfreetype
    * liblcms2
    * libopenjpeg
    * libwebp
* lxml dependencies
    * libxml2
    * libxslt
* Misc dependencies
    * liblzma (required to load GeoZones)
    * libyaml (not mandatory but speed up the yaml processing)
    * libffi (required by bcrypt)

!!! note
    By the time this project was started, Python 3 did not have great third dependencies support
    and some requirements weren't suported yet so it was started with Python 2.7.

### Debian/Ubuntu

On any Debian-like system you can install the development tools and libraries with:

```shell
$ apt-get install build-essential pkg-config python python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv\
    libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libtiff5-dev libfreetype6-dev \
    liblcms2-dev libopenjpeg-dev libwebp-dev libpng12-dev \
    libxml2-dev  libxslt1-dev liblzma-dev libyaml-dev libffi-dev
```

### OSX/Homebrew

On Mac OSX with [Homebrew][], you can install the development tools and libraries with:

```shell
$ brew install automake autoconf libtool pkg-config python \
    libjpeg zlib libtiff freetype littlecms openjpeg webp libpng \
    libxml2 libxslt xz libyaml
```

## MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Redis

The project depends on [MongoDB][] 3.6+, [ElasticSearch][] 2.4 and [Redis][]
(beware of the version, it will not work well if they are not respected).

Elasticsearch requires the [Analysis ICU][analysis-icu] plugin for your specific version.

The installation process is very specific to your operating system
and will depend on your configuration, join us on [Gitter][] if you have any issue.

### Redis

On Debian, as root:

```shell
$ apt-get install redis-server
```

### MongoDB

On Debian Jessie (cf [mongo-install-instructions][] for other versions), as root:

```
$ apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927
$ echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/debian jessie/mongodb-org/3.6 main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.6.list
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install -y mongodb-org
$ service mongod start
```

### ElasticSearch

On Debian, you need to add the appropriate apt repository (cf [elastic-install-instructions][] for more details):

    deb https://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/2.x/debian stable main

and install it like any other Debian package (You might need to enable Debian Backport repository)
The `plugin` command is located in the `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin` directory.

You need a `java` binary in your path for ElasticSearch to operate properly, for example on Debian (as root):

```shell
$ apt-get install default-jre
```

To install ElasticSearch, for example on Debian Jessie, you will have to perform (as root):

```shell
$ echo "deb https://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/2.x/debian stable main" \
    > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch.list
$ echo "deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free" \
    > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-backports.list
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install elasticsearch
$ /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin install analysis-icu
$ service elasticsearch restart
```

If you are using [Homebrew][] (OSX):

```shell
$ brew install elasticsearch
$ /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/2.4.1/libexec/bin/plugin install analysis-icu
```
