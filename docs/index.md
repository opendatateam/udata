**Customizable and skinnable social platform dedicated to (open)data.**

We split the documentation given your profile (help us to improve it if you do not feel comfortable with those!):

## I want to launch the project to play with it locally

The prefered way to test udata is to use the [docker images][]
to easily have an up and ready udata instance.

## I’m a regular developer of the platform

Install [system dependencies](system-dependencies.md)
and then read the `Developping` sections starting with [Development environment](development-environment.md).
Once the project is up and running, it's time to customize it!
Take a look at our advanced documentation on [adapting settings](adapting-settings.md),
[creating a custom theme](creating-theme.md), [testing your code](testing-code.md),
[adding translations](adding-translations.md) and so on.

## I want to use it for my country

The project is currently in production [in France][data-gouv-fr] and [in Luxembourg][data-gouv-lu-repository]. We can help you to set up your infrastructure, you can contact the team via [a Github issue][github-new-issue] or [through Gitter to chat directly][gitter].

Take a look at the [governance](governance.md) section to know how we deal with feature voting from all the community.

To perform a full installation for production purpose, follow the [System dependencies](system-dependencies.md)
and [installation](installation.md) sections.

## I found a bug or I want to propose an improvement

For a bug, please [report it directly as a Github issue][github-new-issue] following the proposed template. We’ll answer you as soon as possible.
