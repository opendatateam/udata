**Customizable and skinnable social platform dedicated to (open)data.**

We split the documentation given your profile (help us to improve it if you do not feel comfortable with those!):


## I want to launch the project to play with it locally

Install both [system](system-dependencies.md) and [local](local-dependencies.md) dependencies. Then [run the project](running-project.md).


## I’m a regular developer of the platform

Once the project is up and running, it's time to customize it! Take a look at our advanced documentation on [adapting settings](adapting-settings.md), [creating a custom theme](creating-theme.md), [testing your code](testing-code.md), [adding translations](adding-translations.md) and so on.


## I want to use it for my country

The project is currently [in production for France][data-gouv-fr] and [in development for Luxembourg][data-gouv-lu-repository]. We can help you to set up your infrastructure, you can contact the team via [a Github issue][github-new-issue] or [through Gitter to chat directly][gitter].


## I found a bug or I want to propose an improvement

For a bug, please [report it directly as a Github issue][github-new-issue] following the proposed template. We’ll answer you as soon as possible.
